# Daily Scrum

- Short timebox, 15 min
- Just the devs and the Scrum master (might have the PO too)


## 3 questions
1. What did you do?
2. What will you do?
3. What problems did you face?

*Answer these questions*


## Basic rules
- At same time
- At same place


## When
- With all team together
- Find the best places
- Not in the extreme times
- A good time is before or right after the lunch
- Or create a break time and make it an routine
